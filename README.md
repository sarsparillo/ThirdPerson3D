# ThirdPerson3D

I have years of (hobbyist) 3d modelling and level design experience, but so far all my game dev practice has been in 2d?  Weird, right?

I want to make 3d games, I'm going to need to make 3d games. That's just straight up the thing of it.  So, I'll do.

This might become a full project, this might just be a playground for testing... alls I know is, if I don't have version control I'm screwed.
